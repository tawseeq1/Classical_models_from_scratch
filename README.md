## Project Overview

I created this repository to store the implementation of some classical ML and DL models from scratch. These were part of the assignments and lab tests in our course AI42001 [Machine Learning Foundations & Applications](https://maheshmohanmr.github.io/files/Teaching_MLFA_2024_spring_ons.pdf).
